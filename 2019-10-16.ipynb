    "We theorize we have $N$ data points from some population (we don't care where from).\n",

    "Where we're interested in some function $T$, but we do not care what function.\n",
    "\n",
    "If $T$ is a guess for a population parameter? How good of a guess is it?  \n",
    "We want to quantify our uncertainty of this parameter (in average squared distance from the parameter)\n",
    "\n",
    "We do this by sampling from our original dataset.  \n",
    "### Bootstrap Procedure\n",
    "Take a new sample (we're gonna call it doubly indexed)\n",
    "$$X_{11},\\dots,X_{1N}$$\n",
    "$$X_{21},\\dots,X_{2N}$$\n",
    "We resample from the original data to simulate resampling from the population. What might be a problem is that if your sample misses an entire section of the support.  \n",
    "**EX**:\n",
    "For example, finding out who is going to win the next presidential election. If you call people on a Friday night, you're entirely missing those who do not have phones and/or missing those who go out Friday night. This is called **biased sampling**. Our goal is that our one sample is unbaised and random.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to quantify our uncertainty, we should repeatedly re-sample *the same size* from our original, replacing the sample when it's picked (so that it could potentially be sampled multiple times). This allows us to have new sets different from the original set. We should be doing this procedure $R$ times.\n",
    "\n",
    "For each of these new sets, we retake the function $T$ on the data, so we have $R$ sample statistics each of which estimating the population parameter as determined by $T$.\n",

    "If $T(\\underline{x})=\\frac{1}{N}\\sum X_n$, then the *sampling distribution* of the curve for the sample mean is approximately normal by the *Central Limit Theorem*  \n",
    "We're trying to understand how the R.V. $T$ behaves from sample to sample thus, it is called the *sampling distribution*.\n",
    "\n",
    "The nice part about the *Bootstrap Procedure* is that it doesn't matter if the function of the data is the sample mean. This means we can still approximate it, and it's not necessarily normal.  \n",
    "Whatever sampling distribution is centered around, it is the estimate for the population parameter.\n",
    "*The whole point of this procedure is not to estimate the population parameter, but to find our uncertainty. The width of the sampling distribution tells us how certain (or uncertain) we are on guessing the population parameter.*  \n",
    "The standard deviation of the sample mean can be represented as $\\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{N}}$ and because $N$ is in the denominator, the more samples we have the more certain we can become -- as the sample size goes up, our uncertainty goes down.\n",
    "\n",
    "The standard deviation of the sample mean is called the **Standard Error**.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a standard error for other parameters $T$, we just don't necessarily know the formula. The only thing we do know is that the formula has the form $\\frac{1}{\\sqrt{N}}$ But we don't need to know the full formula. As long as we have an array of guesses for $T$, then we can just find the standard deviation for the array and estimate the standard error.\n",
